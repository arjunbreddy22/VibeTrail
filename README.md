# VibeTrail: Version Control for Vibe Coding

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue)

**VibeTrail is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically tracks your coding progress by creating snapshots of your workspace. It's like a personal time machine for your code, allowing you to look back at your work without cluttering your main Git history.**

Whether you're experimenting with a new feature, refactoring a complex module, or just want a private record of your daily progress, VibeTrail has you covered.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üè† **Per-Project Shadow Repositories**: Each workspace gets its own dedicated timeline, stored in `~/.vibetrail/{projectName}_hash/`. No cross-project contamination!
- üì∏ **Effortless Snapshots**: Save a complete snapshot of your workspace with a single command. Add unlimited-length prompts or descriptions to remember what you were working on.
- üìö **Interactive Timeline**: Browse your snapshots in a beautiful and intuitive timeline view. See every change you've made in chronological order with expandable prompts.
- üîç **Visual Diff Viewer**: Compare any two snapshots to see exactly what changed. The color-coded diff view makes it easy to spot additions, modifications, and deletions.
- üîÑ **One-Click Restore**: Instantly restore your entire workspace to any previous snapshot. It's a safe and easy way to undo changes or go back to a known good state.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: 
  - **Smart Summaries**: Let AI generate concise, human-readable summaries of the changes between snapshots.
  - **Risk Assessment**: Get an AI-powered analysis of potential risks or issues in your code changes.
  - **Your API Key**: Use your own OpenAI API key for complete control over AI features.

## üíª How to Use

1. **Open the Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
2. **Save a Snapshot**:
   - Run the **`VibeTrail: Save Snapshot`** command.
   - Enter an optional prompt or description (e.g., "Before asking AI to refactor login" or "After implementing user authentication").
   - Prompts can be any length and will be displayed in an expandable format in the timeline.
3. **View Your Timeline**:
   - Run the **`VibeTrail: Show Timeline`** command.
   - In the timeline, you can:
     - **View Diffs**: See the changes between any two snapshots.
     - **Restore**: Revert your workspace to a previous state.
     - **Generate AI Summaries**: Get AI-powered insights into your changes (requires OpenAI API key).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration for AI Features

To enable the AI-powered features, you need to provide your own OpenAI API key:

1. **Get an API Key**: If you don't have one, you can get a key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. **Open IDE Settings**. 
3. **Set the API Key**:
   - Search for **`VibeTrail`**.
   - In the **`VibeTrail: OpenAI API Key`** field, enter your API key.
   - **Important**: Due to how VS Code handles extension settings, you must set the API key in both your **User** and **Workspace** settings for the AI features to be reliably enabled.

## üìÅ What Gets Tracked

VibeTrail is smart about what it tracks. It ignores common development files and directories, including:

- `node_modules/`
- `.git/`, `.gitignore/`, `.gitattributes/`, `.gitmodules/`
- `.vscode/`
- `out/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- `venv/`, `env/`, `.venv/`, `.env`

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the timeline or snapshots:

- **Repair Repository**: Use the **`VibeTrail: Repair Repository`** command to fix corrupted shadow repositories.
- **Check Console**: Open the VS Code Developer Console to see detailed logs.
- **Per-Project Isolation**: Each workspace has its own timeline, so issues in one project won't affect others.
